# An example of using cc65

Demonstrates:

  - C invoking methods written in assembly
  - linking binaries such as custom character sets
  - using the addresses at which binary objects are linked
  - 16-bit pointers in zero-page passed from C to assembly
  - `__fastcall__` for passing the last parameter in the accumulator
  - A linker script with segments at specific addresses
  - A simple Makefile
